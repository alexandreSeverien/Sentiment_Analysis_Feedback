Sentiment Analysis on Feedback Comments
This repository contains Python code for sentiment analysis on a dataset of feedback comments. The project aims to analyze the sentiment of feedback comments using the Flair framework.
Please note that for experimental purposes, this dataset was generated randomly and may not represent real-world feedback accurately.

The main steps of the project include:
* Sentiment Analysis: Using the Flair framework to perform sentiment analysis on the feedback comments.
* Data Visualization: Visualizing the sentiment distribution and sentiment analysis results.

Results
* Total number of comments: 95
* Positive comments: 44
* Negative comments: 50
* Neutral comments: 0
* Net Promoter Score (NPS): 5.26

Insights
* The neutral sentiment label was never observed.
* The confidence scores returned by the sentiment analysis model are treated as intensity levels for experimental purposes.
* The threshold value for classifying comments as promoters or detractors is chosen arbitrarily for experimental purposes.

Conclusion
This project serves as an experimental exploration of sentiment analysis using Flair.
